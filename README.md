The [Caliper Analytics® Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1) 
provides a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data at 
scale. Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API™) for marshalling 
and transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, 
analysis and use.  

*caliper-central* is a clearinghouse for cross-cutting issues that may impact the various Caliper 
repositories maintained in Github.  We use a [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) board to organize, 
track and report on our issues and current work.  Browser [extensions](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) 
for both Chrome and Firefox.  A web/mobile [interface](https://app.zenhub.com/) is also available.
